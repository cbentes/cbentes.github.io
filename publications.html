Abstract: This article describes how the estimation of ship parameters from ship signatures on TerraSAR-X images can be adapted dynamically using combinatorial optimization and regression analysis. Research in the field of ship detection commonly addresses the improvement of processors with regard to accuracy performance of detection and parameter estimation. While most research implies beneficial improvements to the processors, the different techniques are rarely compared or combined. In this article the Monte Carlo combinatorial optimization (cross-entropy method) is used to evaluate the performance of improvements to parameter estimation and performance of combinations of these improvements. Then multiple linear regression analysis is applied to increase the accuracy of parameter estimation further. The underlying data set consists of TerraSAR-X Stripmap, ScanSAR, and ScanSAR Wide Multi Look Ground Range detected (MGD) images acquired over the North Sea and Baltic Sea with horizontal transmit, horizontal receive or vertical transmit, vertical receive polarization. Validation data are provided by the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The optimization algorithm assesses optimal parameter settings and appropriate combinations of techniques dedicated to this data set. The resulting processor provides a significantly higher accuracy of ship parameter estimation than the initial processor.

Abstract: The application of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for ship and iceberg monitoring is important to promote maritime safety in Arctic waters. Although the detection of ships and icebergs in SAR images is well established using adaptive threshold techniques, the discrimination between the two target classes still represents a challenge for operational scenarios. This paper proposes the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship-iceberg discrimination in high resolution TerraSAR-X StripMap images. The CNN model is compared with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the final results indicate a superior classification performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides detailed information of Ocean's surface and man-made floating structures. Advances in SAR technology and deployment of new SAR satellites have contributed to an increasing number of remote sensing data available. Handle this large amount of data with human operators is infeasible. Therefore, the use of automated tools to process remote sensing images, identify regions of interest, and select relevant information are needed. The use of neural networks to solve SAR image classification problems is well known. A typical architecture consists of a shallow feed-forward neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. This type of neural network, combined with back-propagation and a gradient-based training algorithm, is able to solve complex problems in SAR image analysis. However, this architecture is unable to take advantage of unlabeled data during its training process, and in many cases the input features need to be carefully tuned in order to reduce the overall network complexity. This paper proposes the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to perform oceanographic-object classification.

Abstract: Sentinel-1A (S1-A) is the first of a pair of satellites operating a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) developed to give continuity to the European SAR programme. After 6 months commissioning phase from its lunch on April 3rd 2014, S1-A started to systematically deliver data to Copernicus Ocean, Land and Emergency services. Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) mode in dual-polarization VV+VH is the standard acquisition mode used for the observation of the European marine environment. The objectives of this study are the comparison and synergetic use of the S1-A imagery in IWS mode with TerraSAR-X (TS-X) imagery in StripMap mode for SAR ship detection application. Exemplary dataset acquired over the English Channel during a controlled experiment is used to pursue the objective. Automatic Identification System ships messages received by terrestrial stations in the area are used as ground truth and to identify the SAR detections.

Abstract: Obviously, radar resolution and swath width are two very important factors when it comes to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) maritime targets detection. The dilemma of using single polarization SAR imagery with higher resolution and coverage or quad-(or dual-polarimetric) imagery with its richness of information, is still unsolved when it comes to this application. In the framework of ESA project MARISS and EU project DOLPHIN, in situ campaigns aimed at solving this dilemma have been carried  out. Single and multi-polarimetric SAR data acquired by TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2    and COSMO-SkyMed have been acquired with close time gaps and partial coverage overlap. In this way several moving and non-moving maritime targets have been   imaged with different polarization, geometry and working frequency. Available  ground truth reports provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, nautical chart and wind farm location are used to validate the different types of maritime targets.

Abstract: Maritime surveillance is an important application of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite systems, and ship detection plays an important role in the maritime scenario observation. The new Wide ScanSAR TerraSAR-X mode allows larger swath coverage than previous TerraSAR-X modes, therefore the new mode is a natural choice for oceanographic observations. This abstract analyses the use of Wide ScanSAR images for ship detection applications, using a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm. Preliminary results are shown and a comparison with the StripMap mode is performed.

Abstract: A growing interest in global maritime surveillance has motivated the development of new methods and sensors to overcome the limitations of coastal-based systems coverage. Among the available state of the art tools, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) stands out as a powerful sensor for oceanographic observation and maritime surveillance, due to its capability of wide swath coverage and the ability to operate in all weather conditions. This paper examines the minimum ship size detectable by the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm over different TerraSAR-X product modes, using simulation-based analyses. These analyses allow a comparison of the expected CFAR ship detection performance for different TerraSAR-X products, over different sea state conditions.

<b>Carlos Bentes</b>, Osamu Saotome. Robotics Symposium and Latin American Robotics Symposium (SBR-LARS), 2012.

<p class='abstract'>
Abstract: A dynamic swarm formation based in artificial potential fields is presented and extended to 3D environments. A dynamic technic to adjust the swarm configuration when avoiding obstacles is also proposed. Using potential fields in conjunction with a global planner like the A* algorithm allows the navigation through an environment in presence of obstacles. The global planner finds an obstacle free path using a discrete representation of the world and this path is used to guide the center of the swarm formation. Potential field is used to control the swarm formation and to avoid obstacles locally when travelling the planned path. Simulation results are presented for swarm of particles of different sizes in 2D and 3D worlds.
